First run the scraper via the command: <br>
python ./backend/scripts/fbcrawl.py <br>
A Facebook page should pop in and the participant should login <br>
The scraper should then begin <br>

In another terminal window start the backend by calling the commands: <br>
cd backend <br>
flask run <br>

Lastly, in another window, start the frontend by running the commands: <br>
cd frontend <br>
npm start <br>
The frontend should popup alongside the scraper and the participant can start interacting with the UI <br>
